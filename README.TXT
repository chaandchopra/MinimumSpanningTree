PROJECT TITLE: Prims ALgorithm using Min-Heap and Adjancecy List
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Assignment -2 
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: COmpile and right click on main function.
AUTHORS: Chaand Chopra, Mridul Gain
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
Implement the following in C/C++/Java.
    -> Min-heap with all the required functions of the heap.
    -> Adjacency list representation of the graph.
    -> Prim’s algorithm to compute Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted undirected graph using min-heap and adjacency list representation you have implemented.
    -> Graph is present in text file in the following format.
        n m
        u1 v1 w1
        u2 v2 w2
        ………….
Your program should read the input file through command line argument and should display the eedges of MST and total weight of the MST.
